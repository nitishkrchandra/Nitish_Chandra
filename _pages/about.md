Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh, fortunate to be advised by Dr. Kaushik P. Seshadreeshan. [cite_start]My research is dedicated to addressing the foundational challenges in building large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers and networks[cite: 11].

My work primarily focuses on developing practical solutions for **distributed quantum computing**, **quantum networking**, and **quantum error correction**.

## Research Highlights

Here are some of the key projects I am involved in:

* [cite_start]**At the University of Pittsburgh** [cite: 17][cite_start], I am investigating fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures [cite: 19][cite_start], analyzing the security of networks protected by post-quantum cryptography [cite: 21][cite_start], and designing optimal policies for managing entanglement in quantum networks[cite: 24, 25].
* [cite_start]**Through my collaboration with Cisco Quantum Lab** [cite: 27][cite_start], I am developing efficient scheduling methods for network operations in distributed quantum circuits [cite: 29, 30] [cite_start]and analyzing quantum error-correcting codes for these distributed systems[cite: 31, 32].
* [cite_start]**During my internship at IISER Kolkata** [cite: 33][cite_start], I simulated quantum correlations in open systems to develop strategies for mitigating decoherence and enhancing fidelity[cite: 35].

## Education
* [cite_start]**Ph.D. in Information Science** - University of Pittsburgh, 2022-Present [cite: 8, 10]
* [cite_start]**BS-MS in Physical Sciences** - IISER Kolkata, 2016-2021 [cite: 13]

I am always excited to discuss research and potential collaborations. Please feel free to explore my publications or get in touch.
