[cite_start]I am a PhD student in Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh, supervised by Dr. Kaushik P. Seshadreeshan[cite: 8, 9]. [cite_start]My primary research interests include Distributed Quantum Computing, Quantum Networks, and Quantum Error Correction[cite: 11].

## Experience

### Graduate Student Researcher | [cite_start]University of Pittsburgh [cite: 16, 17]
[cite_start]**_Sep 2022 - Present_** [cite: 18]
* [cite_start]Investigated fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computing (FT-MBQC) architectures using dual-species trapped-ion modules[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]Analyzed security models for quantum networks where classical channels are protected by Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]Explored the use of vacuum beam guides as ultra-low-loss links to reduce hardware overhead in quantum repeater networks[cite: 23].
* [cite_start]Developed and simulated optimal scheduling protocols for quantum switches to manage entanglement distribution[cite: 24, 25].

### Pitt-Cisco Collaboration | [cite_start]Cisco Quantum Lab [cite: 26, 27]
[cite_start]**_May 2024 - Present_** [cite: 28]
* [cite_start]Compared resource-constrained project scheduling (RCPSP) and greedy heuristic methods for scheduling network operations in distributed quantum circuits[cite: 29, 30].
* [cite_start]Analyzed quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes for distributed systems, evaluating fault-tolerance thresholds and networking requirements[cite: 31, 32].

### Quantum Research Intern | [cite_start]IISER Kolkata [cite: 33]
[cite_start]**_July 2021 - June 2022_** [cite: 34]
* [cite_start]Simulated quantum correlations in open quantum systems, developed strategies to mitigate decoherence, and applied geometric algebra to characterize multipartite entanglement[cite: 35].
