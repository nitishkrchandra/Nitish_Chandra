### Overview
[cite_start]This work investigates a fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computing (FT-MBQC) architecture that uses dual-species trapped-ion (DSTI) modules. [cite: 19] [cite_start]It leverages multiplexing, quantum repeaters, and a combination of photonic and Coulomb interactions to generate resource-efficient, topologically protected Remotely-Hard-Graphed (RHG) cluster states. [cite: 19]

### Contributions
[cite_start]A key part of this research involves evaluating the fault-tolerance thresholds of this architecture under the effects of hardware imperfections and channel noise in heralded, dual-rail entanglement schemes. [cite: 20]
