### Overview

This work investigates a fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computing (FT-MBQC) architecture that uses dual-species trapped-ion (DSTI) modules. It leverages multiplexing, quantum repeaters, and a combination of photonic and Coulomb interactions to generate resource-efficient, topologically protected Raussendorf-Bravyi-Harrington (RBH) cluster-state code.

### Contributions

A key part of this research involves evaluating the fault-tolerance thresholds of this architecture under the effects of hardware imperfections and channel noise in heralded, dual-rail entanglement schemes.
