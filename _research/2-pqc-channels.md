### Overview
[cite_start]This project analyzes a security model for quantum networks where the available resources are noisy Bell states and classical channels protected by Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). [cite: 21]

### Contributions
[cite_start]The research focuses on quantifying the constraints these resources place on the information accessible to an adversary. [cite: 21] [cite_start]Specifically, it evaluates the impact on fidelity and quantifies the Holevo information under various key leakage dynamics. [cite: 22]
