### Overview
[cite_start]This research focuses on minimizing the execution time of distributed quantum circuits by optimizing network operations. [cite: 29] [cite_start]It formulates the task as a resource-constrained project scheduling (RCPSP) problem and compares its performance against greedy heuristic methods. [cite: 29]

### Contributions
* [cite_start]Nonlocal gate requirements are extracted after partitioning a circuit across multiple QPUs. [cite: 30]
* [cite_start]Network operations (entanglement and swaps) are scheduled to enable these entangling gates under limited resource availability. [cite: 30]
* [cite_start]The project also involves analyzing quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes for these distributed networks to evaluate fault-tolerance thresholds and the networking requirements needed to support them. [cite: 31, 32]
