### The Challenge: Scaling Quantum Networks
Building large-scale quantum networks requires transmitting fragile quantum states over long distances. Standard optical fibers suffer from signal loss, which necessitates complex quantum repeaters with significant hardware resources to correct for errors and extend the range of communication.

### Our Approach: Ultra-Low-Loss Links
This research explores the use of **vacuum beam guides** as an alternative to traditional fiber. These guides function as ultra-low-loss links, minimizing the signal degradation that occurs during transmission.

### Key Findings
By integrating vacuum beam guides into quantum repeater network architectures, we demonstrate two key benefits:
* A significant **reduction in the hardware overhead** required at each repeater node.
* **Improved performance trade-offs** across all three generations of quantum repeater protocols, enabling more efficient long-distance quantum communication.
