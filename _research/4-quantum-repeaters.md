### Overview
[cite_start]This project explores the use of vacuum beam guides as ultra-low-loss links within quantum repeater networks. [cite: 23]

### Contributions
[cite_start]By incorporating these guides, the research shows a significant reduction in hardware overhead. [cite: 23] [cite_start]It also demonstrates improved performance trade-offs across all three generations of quantum repeaters. [cite: 23]
