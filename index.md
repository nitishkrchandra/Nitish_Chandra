Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Informatics and Networked Systems at the School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh, advised by Dr. Kaushik P. Seshadreesan. My research is dedicated to addressing the foundational challenges in building large scale fault tolerant quantum computers and networks.

My work primarily focuses on developing practical solutions for **distributed quantum computing**, **quantum networking**, and **quantum error correction**.

## Research Highlights

Here are some of the key projects I am involved in:

- **At the University of Pittsburgh**, I am investigating fault tolerant quantum computing architectures, analyzing the security of networks protected by post quantum cryptography, and designing optimal policies for managing entanglement in quantum networks.
- **Through my collaboration with Cisco Quantum Lab**, I am developing efficient scheduling methods for network operations in distributed quantum circuits and analyzing quantum error correcting codes for these distributed systems.
- **During my internship at IISER Kolkata**, I simulated quantum correlations in open systems to develop strategies for mitigating decoherence and enhancing fidelity.

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Information Science** – University of Pittsburgh, 2022 to present  
- **BS MS in Physical Sciences** – IISER Kolkata, 2016 to 2021

I am always excited to discuss research and potential collaborations. Please feel free to explore my publications or get in touch.
