Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Informatics and Networked Systems at School of Computing and Information University of Pittsburgh, advised by Dr. Kaushik P. Seshadreeshan.

My research focuses on addressing the challenges of realizing large scale fault tolerant quantum computers and networks. I study these architectures under realistic noise and resource constraints, tackling problems across multiple abstraction levels such as modeling distributed architectures, scheduling network operations, transpilation and compilation for networked systems, and analyzing the error thresholds of quantum error correcting codes within these architectures.

## Research Highlights  

Here are some of the key projects I am involved in:  

* **At the University of Pittsburgh**, I am investigating **fault tolerant quantum computing architectures**, analyzing the **security of networks protected by post quantum cryptography**, and designing and simulating **optimal policies for entanglement distribution** in quantum networks. I am also working on **quantum combinatorial optimization** using **tensor networks** and the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** to address core tasks such as **optimizing financial portfolios**, **scheduling complex manufacturing workflows**, and **detecting community structures in large scale networks**.  

* **Through my collaboration with Cisco Research**, I am developing **efficient scheduling methods** for **network operations in distributed quantum circuits** and analyzing **quantum error correcting codes** for these distributed systems. This includes reducing **latency** and **resource overhead** during nonlocal gate execution, evaluating **code thresholds** under realistic noise and connectivity constraints, and studying **compiler and decoder choices** that improve reliability in modular architectures.  

* **At IISER Kolkata**,  I **simulated quantum correlations in noisy quantum systems**, developed **strategies to mitigate decoherence and enhance fidelity**, and applied **geometric algebra** to characterize **multipartite entanglement** in **quantum algorithms and interferometry**.
